SIMPLE USAGE C++ REST SDK

Here, I made some examples of usage of C++ REST SDK from scratch. There are four simple examples:
1. cpprestsdk-1
Contain very basic usage of C++ REST SDK.

2. cpprestsdk-2
Here, I give example usage of how to use handler of HTTP Listener Support method.

3. cpprestsdk-3
This example contain expand class based on cpprestsdk-1 and cpprestsdk-2.

4. cpprestsdk-4
In this example, I made some class with header files and organize it become simple example server app.

To build these examples are easy. For cpprestsdk-1 until cpprestsdk-3, just do the following command from terminal

g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o main -lboost_system -lcrypto -lssl -lcpprest
./main

For example cpprestsdk-4, do the following command

g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp src/*.cpp -o main -lboost_system -lcrypto -lssl -lcpprest
./main
